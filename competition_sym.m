%EDITED 12-7
%need simulations with density dependent and density independent
%competition. to accomplish this, I'm simply taking out the nis and njs
%from the computation of r.

%EDITED 11-13 so that probabilities are not updated as species die: if a
%particular sps has a high probability of dying at the start of thinning,
%it has a high probability of dying at the end of thinning.

%a function for symmetrical competition (all species have an effect on each
%other regardless of life stage)

function [outputmatrix] = competition_sym(spsmatrix,total,k,alpha,sigsq,C,npC)
overk = find(total>k);%gives you the indices to these microsites that have occupancy > k

for comp = 1:length(overk)%do this microsite by microsite
    
    %get the x,y coordinate for the overk(comp) you're on.

    %find the R(x,y) of each species - this is the competitive
    %ability of each species defined by a gaussian fxn.  The closer
    %a species niche (npC) is to C(x,y), the higher its R.

    %the diffC sims.
